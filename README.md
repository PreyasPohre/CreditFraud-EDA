# CreditFraud-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze the patterns present in the data which will make sure that the loans are not rejected for the applicants capable of repaying.

**Business Problem:**
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their inadequate or missing credit history. When the company receives a loan application, the company has the rights for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 

Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s or company’s decision:

1. If the aspirant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan tends in a business loss to the company
2. If the a is aspirant not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default/fraud, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The data contains information about the loan application.
When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the bank/company:
1. Approved
2. Cancelled
3. Refused
4. Unused offer: The loan has been cancelled by the applicant but at different stages of the process.
   
**Business Goal**

Recognition of such aspirants using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques is the main focus of this case study.
