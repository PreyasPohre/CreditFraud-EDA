# CreditFraud-EDA
This project involved conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the credit history of loan applicants. The primary goal was to minimize loan rejections for individuals with the financial capability to repay. Through the analysis, key indicators were identified to predict the likelihood of applicants fulfilling their loan instalments. The insights gained from these patterns were intended to guide strategic decisions, such as minimizing loan denials, adjusting loan amounts, and considering different interest rates based on the assessed risk.

**Business Problem:**
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their inadequate or missing credit history. When the company receives a loan application, the company has the rights for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 

Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s or company’s decision:

1. If the aspirant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan tends in a business loss to the company
2. If the a is aspirant not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default/fraud, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The data contains information about the loan application.
When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the bank/company:
1. Approved
2. Cancelled
3. Refused
4. Unused offer: The loan has been cancelled by the applicant but at different stages of the process.
   
**Business Goal**
This case study aims to identify patterns that indicate if an applicant will repay their instalments which may be used for taking further actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending at a higher interest rate, etc. This will make sure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Recognition of such aspirants using EDA techniques is the main focus of this case study.
